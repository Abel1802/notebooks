# Reflection of my listening practice

## A thought for my English listening practice (1-12-2022).

It was boring when I practiced my English listening (4000 essential words). So I just thought it was not a purple way to learn a new language. But what is the best way for me to practice my English listening? I was very anxious when I didn't understand the content of a conversation when a person talking with me.

I knew the truth that one person must pay much more effort if he wants a success in something. But it's so hard to do a thing that you didn't like it. I concluded some reasons I couldn't do it.

- Not study in proper time. (like, I was tired)

- Not have a clear goal.

- Not have a strong eager.

---

So I should make some change to my English listening practice. 

- I should try some different time in day to practice listening. 

- I should make some clear goals for the short-term and the long-term object. (give myself a reward if I finish my daily goals, otherwise punishment myself.)


### some important experience for updating (3-12-2022)

- I would more likely to continue my study planning if I get positive feedback.
e.g. When I understood the main meaning of the roundtable, a podcast, I want to continue my listening practice.
