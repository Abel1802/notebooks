## A thought for my English listening practice (1-12-2022)

It was boring when I practiced my English listening (4000 essential words). So I just thought it was not a purple way to learn a new language. But what is the best way for me to practice my English listening? I was very anxious when I didn't understand the content of a conversation when a person talking with me. I knew the truth that one person must pay much more effort if he wants a success in something. But it's so hard to do a thing that you didn't like it. I concluded some reasons I couldn't do it.

- [x] Not study in proper time. (like, I was tired)

- [x] Not have a clear goal.

- [x] Not have a strong eager.

### So I should make some change to my English listening practice

- [ ] I should try some different time in day to practice listening

- [ ] I should make some clear goals for the short-term and the long-term object

- [ ] Give me a reward if I finish my daily goals

### Some important experience for updating

- I would more likely to continue my study planning if I get positive feedback.(3-12-2022)
  > e.g. When I understood the main meaning of the roundtable, a podcast, I want to continue my listening practice.
