## A thought for my English listening practice.

It was boring when I practiced my English listening (4000 essential words). So I just thought it was not a purple way to learn a new language. But what is the best way for me to practice my English listening? I was very anxious when I didn't understand the content of a conversation when a person talking with me.

I knew the truth that one perpon must pay much more effort if he want a success in something. But it's so hard to do a thing that you didn't like it. I concluded some reasones I couldn't do it.

- Not study in proper time. (like, I was tired)

- Not have a clear goal.

- Not have a strong eager.

So I should make some change to my english listening practice. 

- I should try some different time in day to practice listening. 

- I should make some clear goals for the short-term and the long-term object. (give myself a reward if I finish my daily goals, otherwise panish myself.)
